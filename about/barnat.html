            <h1>What is  Drug</h1>
            <p>A pharmaceutical drug (also referred to as medicine, medication, or simply as drug) is a drug used to diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent disease.
            Drug therapy (pharmacotherapy) is an important part of the medical field and relies on the science of pharmacology for continual advancement and on pharmacy for appropriate management.
            </br>A drug is any substance (other than food that provides nutritional support) that, when inhaled, injected, smoked, consumed, absorbed via a patch on the skin, or dissolved under the tongue causes a temporary physiological (and often psychological) change in the body.
            </br>In pharmacology, a pharmaceutical drug, also called a medication or medicine, is a chemical substance used to treat, cure, prevent, or diagnose a disease or to promote well-being.
            Traditionally drugs were obtained through extraction from medicinal plants, but more recently also by organic synthesis.Pharmaceutical drugs may be used for a limited duration,
            or on a regular basis for chronic disorders</p>

                    <h1 style="color:#ff5630;">The Top 10 diseases in the World</h1>
<p>When people think of the deadliest diseases in the world, their minds probably jump to the fast-acting, incurable ones that grab headlines from time to time. But in fact, many of these types of diseases donâ€™t rank in the top 10 causes of worldwide deaths. An estimated 56.4 million people passed away worldwide in 2015, and 68 percent of them were due to diseases that progressed slowly.
Perhaps even more surprising is that several of the deadliest diseases are partially preventable. Non-preventable factors include where a person lives, access to preventive care, and quality of healthcare. These all factor into risk. But there are still steps everyone can take to lower their risk.
Read on to see the top 10 diseases causing the most deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>

<h2 class="content_head">1. Ischemic heart disease,or coronary artery disease</h2>
<div class="content_body">

    <img class="icon" src="../image/D1.jpg" alt="Schemic Heart Disease">

<p>The deadliest disease in the world is coronary artery
disease (CAD). Also called ischemic heart disease, CAD occurs when the blood
vessels that supply blood to the heart become narrowed. Untreated CAD can lead
to chest pain, heart failure, and arrhythmias.</p>

<h3>Impact of CAD across the world</h3>
<p>Although itâ€™s still the leading cause of death, mortality
rates have declined in many European countries and in the United States. This
may be due to better public health education, access to healthcare, and forms
of prevention. However, in many developing nations, mortality rates of CAD are
on the rise. An increasing life span, socioeconomic changes, and lifestyle risk
factors play a role in this rise.</p>

<h3>Risk factors and prevention</h3>
<p>Risk factors for CAD include:</p>
<ul><li>high blood pressure</li>
    <li>high cholesterol</li>
    <li>smoking</li>
    <li>family history of CAD</li>
    <li>diabetes</li>
    <li>being overweight</li></ul>

<p>You can prevent CAD with medications and by maintaining good
heart health. Some steps you can take to decrease your risk include:</p>

<ul><li>exercising regularly</li><li>maintaining a healthy weight</li><li>eating a balanced diet thatâ€™s low in sodium and
high in fruits and vegetables</li><li>avoiding smoking</li><li>drinking only in moderation</li></ul>
</div>


<h2 class="content_head">2. Stroke</h2>
<div class="content_body">
    <img class="icon" src="../image/2.jpg" alt="Stroke">
<p>A stroke occurs when an artery in your brain is blocked or
leaks. This causes the oxygen-deprived brain cells to begin dying within
minutes. During a stroke, you feel sudden numbness and confusion or have
trouble walking and seeing. If left untreated, a stroke can cause long-term
disability.</p>

<p>In fact, strokes are the leading cause
of long-term disabilities. People who receive treatment within 3 hours of
having a stroke are less likely to have disabilities. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/facts.htm">Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> reports that 93 percent of people knew
sudden numbness on one side was a stroke symptom. But only 38 percent knew all
the symptoms that would prompt them to seek emergency care. </p>

<h3>Risk factors and prevention</h3>
<p>Risk factors for stroke include:</p>
<ul><li>high blood pressure</li><li>family history of stroke</li><li>smoking, especially when combined with oral
contraceptives</li><li>being African-American</li><li>being female</li></ul>

<p>Some risk factors of strokes can be reduced with
preventative care, medications, and lifestyle changes. In general, good health
habits can lower your risk.</p>

<p>Stroke prevention methods may include controlling high blood
pressure with medications or surgery. You should also maintain a healthy
lifestyle, complete with regular exercise and a healthy diet thatâ€™s low in
sodium. Avoid smoking, and drink only in moderation, as these activities
increase your risk of
stroke.</p>
</div>
      

<h2 class="content_head">3. Lower respiratory infections</h2>
<div class="content_body">

    <img class="icon" src="../image/3.jpg" alt="Lower respiratory infections">
    
<p>A lower respiratory infection is an infection in your
airways and lungs. It can be due to:</p>
<ul><li>influenza, or the flu</li><li>pneumonia</li><li>bronchitis</li><li>tuberculosis</li></ul>

<p>Viruses usually cause lower respiratory infections. They can
also be caused by bacteria. Coughing is the main symptom of a lower respiratory
infection. You may also feel breathlessness, wheezing, and a tight feeling in
your chest. Untreated lower respiratory infections can lead to breathing
failure and death.</p>

<h3>Risk factors and prevention</h3>

<p>Risk factors for lower respiratory infection include:</p>

<ul><li>the flu</li><li>poor air quality or frequent exposure to lung
irritants</li><li>smoking</li><li>a weak immune system</li><li>crowded childcare settings, which mainly affects
infants</li><li>asthma</li><li>HIV</li></ul>

<p>One of the best preventative measures you can take against
lower respiratory
infections is to get the flu shot every year. People at high risk of
pneumonia can also get a vaccine. Wash your hands regularly with soap and water
to avoid transmitted bacteria, especially before touching your face and before
eating. Stay at home and rest until you feel better if you have a respiratory
infection, as rest improves healing.</p>

<h2 class="content_head">4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</h2>
<div class="content_body">

    <img class="icon" src="../image/4.jpg" alt="Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease">

<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD)is a long-term, progressive
lung disease that makes breathing difficult. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema
are types of COPD. In 2004, about 64 million people
around the world were living with COPD.</p>

<h3>Risk factors and prevention</h3>
<p>Risk factors for COPD include:</p>
<ul><li>smoking or secondhand smoke</li><li>lung irritants like chemical fumes</li><li>family history, with the AATD gene being linked
to COPD</li><li>history of respiratory infections as a child</li></ul>

<p>Thereâ€™s no cure for COPD, but its progression can be slowed
with medication. The best ways to prevent COPD are to stop smoking and to avoid
secondhand smoke and other lung irritants. If you experience any COPD
symptoms, getting treatment as soon as possible increases your outlook.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="content_head">5. Trachea, bronchus, and lung cancers</h2>
<div class="content_body">
      
    <img class="icon" src="../image/5.jpg" alt="Trachea, bronchus, and lung cancers">
    
<p>Respiratory cancers include cancers of the trachea, larynx,
bronchus, and lungs.
The main causes are smoking, secondhand smoke, and environmental toxins. But
household pollutions such as fuels and mold also contribute.</p>

<h3>Risk factors and prevention</h3>
<p>Trachea, bronchus, and lung cancers can affect anyone, but theyâ€™re
most likely to affect those who have a history of smoking or tobacco use. Other
risk factors for these cancers include family history and exposure to
environmental factors, such as diesel fumes.</p>
<p>Aside from avoiding fumes and tobacco products, it isnâ€™t
known if thereâ€™s anything else that can be done to prevent lung cancers. However,
early detection can improve your outlook and reduce the symptoms of respiratory
cancer.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="content_head">6. Diabetes mellitus</h2>
<div class="content_body">

    <img class="icon" src="../image/6.jpg" alt="Diabetes mellitus">

<p>Diabetes is a group of diseases that affect insulin production and use. In type 1
diabetes, the pancreas canâ€™t produce insulin. The cause isnâ€™t known. In type 2
diabetes, the pancreas doesnâ€™t produce enough insulin, or insulin canâ€™t be used
effectively. Type 2 diabetes can be caused by a number of factors, including
poor diet, lack of exercise, and being overweight.</p>

<p>People in low- to middle-income countries are more likely to
die of complications from diabetes.</p>

<h3>Risk factors and prevention</h3>
<p>Risk factors for diabetes include:</p>
<ul><li>excess body weight</li><li>high blood pressure</li><li>older age</li><li>not exercising regularly</li><li>an unhealthy diet</li></ul>

<p>While diabetes isnâ€™t always preventable, you can control the
severity of symptoms by exercising regularly and maintaining good nutrition. Adding
more fiber to your diet can help with controlling your blood sugar.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="content_head">7. Alzheimerâ€™s disease and other dementias</h2>
<div class="content_body">

    <img class="icon" src="../image/7.jpg" alt="Alzheimerâ€™s disease and other dementias">    

<p>When you think of Alzheimerâ€™s disease or dementia, you might
think of a loss of memory, but you might not think of a loss of life. Alzheimerâ€™s
disease is a progressive disease that destroys memory and interrupts normal
mental functions. These include thinking, reasoning, and typical behavior. </p>

<p>Alzheimerâ€™s disease is the most common type of dementia â€” 60 to 80
percent of dementia cases are in fact Alzheimerâ€™s. The disease starts off
by causing mild memory problems, difficulty recalling information, and slips in
recollection. Over time, however, the disease progresses and you may not have
memory of large periods of time. A 2014 study found that the
number of deaths in the United States due to Alzheimerâ€™s may be higher than
reported.</p>

<h3>Risk factors and prevention</h3>
<p>Risk factors for Alzheimerâ€™s disease include:</p>
<ul><li>being older than 65</li><li>a family history of the disease</li><li>inheriting genes for the disease from your
parents</li><li>existing mild cognitive impairment</li><li>Down syndrome</li><li>unhealthy lifestyle</li><li>being female</li><li>previous head trauma</li><li>being shut off from a community or having poor
engagement with other people for extended periods of time</li></ul>

<p>Thereâ€™s not currently a way to prevent Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
Researches arenâ€™t clear why some people develop it and others donâ€™t. As they
work to understand this, theyâ€™re also working to find preventive techniques.</p>

<p>One thing that may be helpful in reducing your risk of the
disease is a heart-healthy diet. A diet thatâ€™s high in fruits and vegetables,
low in saturated fats from meat and dairy, and high in sources of good fats
like nuts, olive oil, and lean fish may help you reduce your risk of more than
just heart disease â€” they may protect your brain from Alzheimerâ€™s disease, too.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="content_head"> 8. Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases</h2>
<div class="content_body">

    <img class="icon" src="../image/8.jpg" alt="Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases">

<p>Diarrhea is when you pass three or more loose stools in a
day. If your diarrhea lasts more than a few days, your body loses too much
water and salt. This causes dehydration, which can lead to death. Diarrhea is
usually caused by an intestinal virus or bacteria transmitted through
contaminated water or food. Itâ€™s particularly widespread in developing nations with
poor sanitary conditions.</p>

<p>Diarrheal disease is the second top cause of death in children younger than 5 years. About 760,000
children die from diarrheal diseases each year.</p>

<h3>Risk factors and prevention</h3>
<p>Risk factors for diarrheal diseases include:</p>
<ul><li>living in an area with poor sanitary conditions</li><li>no access to clean water</li><li>age, with children being the most likely to
experience severe symptoms of diarrheal diseases</li><li>malnourishment</li><li>a weakened immune system</li></ul>

<p>According to UNICEF, the best method of
prevention is practicing good hygiene. Good handwashing techniques can reduce
the incidence of diarrheal diseases by 40 percent. Improved sanitization and
water quality as well as access to early medical intervention can also help
prevent diarrheal diseases. </p>
</div>

<h2 class="content_head">9. Tuberculosis</h2>
<div class="content_body">

    <img class="icon" src="../image/9.jpg" alt="Tuberculosis">
    
<p>Tuberculosis
(TB)is a lung condition caused by bacteria called <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. Itâ€™s a
treatable airborne virus, although some strains are resistant to conventional
treatments. TB is one of the top causes of death in people who have HIV. About 35
percent of HIV-related deaths are due to TB.</p>

<p>The cases of TB have fallen 1.5
percent each year since 2000. The goal is to end TB by 2030.</p>

<h3>Risk factors and prevention</h3>
<p>Risk factors for tuberculosis include:</p>
<ul><li>diabetes</li><li>HIV infection</li><li>a lower body weight</li><li>proximity to others with TB</li><li>regular use of certain medications like
corticosteroids or drugs that suppress the immune system</li></ul>

<p>The best prevention against TB is to get the bacillus
Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. This is commonly given to children. If you think
youâ€™ve been exposed to TB bacteria, you can start taking a treatment medication
called chemoprophylaxis to reduce the likelihood of developing the condition.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="content_head">10. Cirrhosis</h2>
<div class="content_body">
      
    <img class="icon"  src="../image/10.jpg" alt=" Cirrhosis">
    
<p>Cirrhosis is the
result of chronic or long-term scarring and damage to the liver. The damage may
be the result of a kidney disease, or it can be caused by conditions like hepatitis
and chronic alcoholism. A healthy liver filters harmful substances from your
blood and sends healthy blood into your body. As substances damage the liver,
scar tissue forms. As more scar tissue forms, the liver has to work harder to
function properly. Ultimately, the liver may stop working.</p>

<h3>Risk factors and prevention</h3>
<p>Risk factors for
cirrhosis include:</p>

<p>Stay away from the
behaviors that can lead to liver damage to help prevent cirrhosis. Long-term
alcohol use and abuse is one of the leading causes of cirrhosis, so avoiding
alcohol can help you prevent damage. Likewise, you can avoid nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease by eating a diet thatâ€™s healthy, rich in fruits and vegetables,
and low in sugar and fat. Lastly, you can reduce the likelihood of contracting
viral hepatitis by using protection during sex and by avoiding sharing anything
that could have traces of blood. This includes needles, razors, toothbrushes,
and more.</p>

<h2 class="content_head">The takeaway</h2>
<div class="content_body">

<p>While deaths from some diseases have increased, those from
more serious conditions have also decreased. Some factors, such as an increasing
life span, naturally increase the incidence of diseases such as CAD, stroke,
and heart disease. But many of the diseases on this list are preventable and
treatable. As medicine continues to advance and prevention education grows, we
may see a reduction in death rates from these diseases.</p>

<p>A good approach to lowering your risk of any of these
conditions is to live a healthy lifestyle with good nutrition and exercise.
Avoiding smoking and drinking in moderation can also help. For bacterial or
viral infections, proper handwashing can help prevent or reduce your risk.</p>
